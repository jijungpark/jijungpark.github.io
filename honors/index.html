            <h3 class="mb-0">Introduction</h3>
            <div class="mb-5">The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising at an alarming rate worldwide, presenting a serious health epidemic. Previous studies have demonstrated that cognition is negatively impacted by obesity, and thus excess body weight is a risk factor for not only physical health problems, but also cognitive impairment. Set-shifting is a key component of executive functions defined as the cognitive flexibility to adapt behaviors in response to changing environment. This study aims to investigate the relationship between set-shifting and weight among adolescents between 16 and 22 years of age. It is hypothesized that <span class="text-primary">set-shifting abilities are better in adolescents at healthy weights and decline as their weight increases</span>.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Method</h3>   

            <div class="subheading mb-0">Participants</div>        
            <div class="mb-3">Participants in this study included a total of <span class="text-primary">160 adolescents and young adults between 16 and 22 years of age</span>. Of those participants, 66 were male and 94 female. The participants were divided into two weight status categories: obese and healthy weight. In total, there were 108 obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m^2 or 95th percentile) and 52 healthy weight participants (BMI < 30 kg/m^2 or < 95th percentile). The two study groups were matched demographically on age, gender, education, and race. </div>

            <div class="subheading mb-0">Design & Procedure</div>
            <div class="mb-5">Participants who met inclusion criteria were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological assessments on two separate days to examine the primary cognitive domains most associated with weight. The focus for this study was executive functioning, specifically set-shifting as measured by the following objective tests: <span class="text-primary">Trail Making Test, Stroop Test, and Category Test</span>. The research design of this study was correlational and non-experimental. </div>


            <h3 class="mb-0">Results</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-0">Demographics</div>        
            <div class="mb-3">In terms of demographics, there were no differences between healthy weight and obese groups on age, sex, education, ethnicity, and estimated full-scale IQ. As expected, BMI differed significantly between healthy weight (M = 21.5775, SD = 1.81487) and obese (M = 35.2623, SD = 4.73870) groups, t(158) = -20.100, p < .001. Hence, the results of the two-tailed independent samples t-test revealed that <span class="text-primary">demographic variables were not confounded with weight</span> and that they were not contributing to the potential differences between the two weight groups in set-shifting.</div>

            <div class="subheading mb-0">Cognitive Data</div>
            <div class="mb-5">Results indicated that there was a <span class="text-primary">significant difference between healthy weight and obese groups on Trails Making difference score (B-A)</span>, with a p-value of .027. However, no significant weight group differences were found for the variables on the other two tests. </div>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Discussion</div>
            <div class="mb-3"> Although the study only found a significant weight group difference in Trails B-A, it is <span class="text-primary">more diagnostic than the other two tests in predicting set-shifting ability</span> due to removing the influence of motor speed and visual scanning speed on performance.</div>

            <div class="subheading mb-0">Strengths</div>
            <ol>
              <li><span class="text-primary">Large sample size</span></li>
              <li><span class="text-primary">Demographically well-matched groups</span></li>
              <li><span class="text-primary">Standardized neuropsychological measures</span></li>
            </ol>

            <div class="subheading mb-0">Limitation</div>
            <ol>
              <li><span class="text-primary">Cross-sectional design</span> - does not take into account individual variability in rates of maturation of the frontal lobe during adolescence</li>
              <li><span class="text-primary">Unknown obesity trajectories</span> - some participants could have been obese for a long periods of time while others could have only recently become obese and thus, any possible differences in set-shifting ability may not have appeared yet</li>
              <li><span class="text-primary">Young and healthy participants</span> - they may still have the capability to perform well on set-shifting tasks</li>
            </ol>
